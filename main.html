	<h1> Why I want to become a developer? </h1>
	<p> 
		my main reason to become a developer is I always wanted to be in a role that
		I can use my creative skils and problem solving skils to improve myself and 
		finally I decided that this is the role what i want to be in. The another reason is in a developer role there 
		is always something remaing to learn that leads to me to "continuous learning" and one more thing is as a developer I 
		have to thing about new problems and myself will enjoy to find solutions to some new problems.
